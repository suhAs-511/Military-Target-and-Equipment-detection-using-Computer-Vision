# Military-Target-and-Equipment-detection-using-Computer-Vision
Military target detection technology is the foundation and key to perceive and analyze the battlefield situation, and it is also the premise of target tracking technology. Aiming at the task of military target detection, the detection performance of traditional detection algorithms is poor in complex environment. We realized automatic detection of military targets in complex environment through deep learning. In this project, we improved the components of YOLOv3 and proposed a novel military target detection algorithm (YOLO-v7). We have built a military target dataset composed of armed men with different weapons, which provides a test environment for various object detection algorithms.
